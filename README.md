# Guess The Number
Program where the user guesses a random integer that is generated between 1 and 100.

## How it works
* A random integer will be generated by the `generate_number` function between a minimum and maximum value specified in Max_value and Min_value variables.	
* The `guess_number` function will then validate user input and check if the number is above or below the generated number. The user has the option of quitting out of guessing numbers by inputting the number 0 as an answer.
* Once the number has been correctly guessed by the user the `replay` function will give the option to play again or quit.
* `game_loop` runs the main game loop.
